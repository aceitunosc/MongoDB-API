# MongoDB-API
API dashboard that creates a dashboard to search rescuse dogs by type, location, breed, and the dogs future job.

The above API is a projcet I did in class for SNHU. The project descrition was to create an API that brings up dashboard that will allow the user to search out rescuse dogs. The dashboard allows the user to search these dogs through a couple of ways depending upon what the use wants to know. The API uses MongoDB to allow the user to search dogs by type of rescuse. The dashboard will show the user what breeds are best for being trained for that type or rescue. They can also search by breed, location, and age. to use the API you just need to have and instnace of MongoDB open and logged in. Unfortunalty I have not done much to this API since I made it so the username and logine for MongoDB is hardcoded in.
